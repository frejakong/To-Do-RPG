## **Project Title:**

To-Do RPG 

## **Project Background:** 

Most people procrastinate these days, and unless it's an emergency, we tend to procrastinate. Over time, this can wear down our morale. The more tasks we accumulate, the more painful it is to have to rush through deadlines. How to make tasks fun and enjoyable to complete is an important topic. 

Role-playing Game, or RPG, is a type of game that most players are exposed to, which has three main characteristics: "story", "growth" and "interactivity", so it is very playable and interesting. It is very appropriate to combine the concept of to-do list with RPG, because the operations of the to-do list and other operations need user interaction, we let the user as a role in the game, like growing in the story, can make the completion of tasks no longer full of resistance. 

## **Project Summary:** 

The purpose of my development project is to make an app that combines the user's to-do list with the RPG. In RPG (role-playing game), the player plays a single character or multiple characters in a real or fictional world. The player is responsible for playing the role and developing the role by taking actions under a structured rule. In To-Do RPG users can choose their own roles to play, and then complete the development of game roles by sorting out tasks and completing to-do items 

## **Project Introduction:** 

###  **Basic Setting** 

After users first enter the app, they need to register, then create their own characters by choosing a class and race based on their preferences. 

After the establishment of the player image, each user has the life value, experience value, attribute value, gold coin and other settings.

### **To-do List** 

This function is similar to other to-do apps' users can manage their to-do items. In TO-Do RPG, users can set different categories for different to-do items according to their results. 

### **Reward Mechanism** 

The biggest feature of To-Do RPG is its reward system. Users can get the experience value, gold coins or equipment automatically given by the system after completing the tasks you set and add the corresponding attribute value according to the category of the to-do item. 

### **Additional Functions** 

To-Do RPG has attribute value options, including strength, intelligence, physique and perception. Different attributes correspond to the adventure, the increase of experience gained, the reduction of damage received and the increase of the chance of falling items. The adventure task is not directly encountered, but needs to spend experience value, gold coins or diamonds to obtain, through completing their to-do items. 

## **Project Goals/ Objectives:** 

To-Do RPG, as a to-do list app that helps us to complete tasks in the way of games, breaks the dimensional wall between games and real life, can make us as full of fighting spirit in daily life as RPG characters. All the player images will be displayed in pixel style, which makes people enter into the atmosphere of the game, almost forgetting that this is actually a to-do application. 

This app imitates the core of the RPG and sets up the positive feedback system with the same reward mechanism as the games, so that users can get satisfaction while completing tasks. Ideally, this app will not only make our life gamified, but also makes us more efficient.
